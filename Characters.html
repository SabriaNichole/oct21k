            <h2>Top 3 Spirited Away Characters</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>1. Chiharu</h3>
        <p>- Did you know? Chihiro was inspired by Miyazaki's friend's apathetic 10-year-old daughter.</p>

        <p>- At the time, Miyazaki was retired and working on personal projects, but after an unexpected spark on inspiration, he began work on Spirited Away. The filmmaker takes a yearly sabbatical every summer, often visiting at a mountain cabin with friends and family. After observing his friend's sullen, apathetic 10-year-old daughter, he was inspired to create a character like Chihiro.
        </p>

        <p>- A gangly, ten-year-old human girl, heroine of the movie. At first Chihiro is sullen, whiny, and afraid, with an annoying voice and sulky face. After her name is changed to Sen, she becomes brave and self-sufficient enough to free herself and her parents from the spirit world. As Sen evolves, her voice becomes less grating and her expression lifts and glows. By the end of the movie, when she becomes Chihiro again, her features appear much more mature. She is notable for her lack of greed, her respect for her elders, and her kindness toward others. These qualities cause those she meets to respect, love, and help her.</p>
